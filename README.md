# WiLSpreadsheets

[View the directory here](directory.md).

## Instructions

To add yourself to the list, copy the text below and paste it on a new line at the end of the `directory.md` file in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WomeninLogic/WiLSpreadsheets), and then replace the filler text with your relevant information (i.e. replace `Surname` with your surname, `Given name` with your given name, and so on).

> ```Surname | Given name | Institution (country) | Position | Website | Areas (separate by commas)```

If you wish to omit certain information then simply replace the corresponding word with a space, e.g. to leave the `Website` and field blank, you would do as follows:

> ```Surname | Given name | Institution (country) | Position | | Areas (separate by commas)```
